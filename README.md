# Audio Code Demo
A demonstration of how to use Python code to interact with audio

Demonstrations include:

* How to generate a sine tone of a specific frequency
* Visualization and playback of audio
* How to generate a chirp or frequency sweep
* How to record audio using your computer's mic
* How to load a wav file
* How to filter audio

# Setup

1. Install Python
2. Install Git
3. Clone this repository & navigate to it from command line
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```
4. Install required Python packages
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
5. Launch the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook AudioDemo.ipynb
```
6. Run the notebook. I find it best to run one cell at a time, with `Shift + Enter`
7. Play around! Try editing and running the code cells to play with audio in your own way.
