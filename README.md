# Audio Code Demo

A demonstration of how to use Python code to interact with audio. Aimed at beginners to audio and code, approximately high school level.

Note this demo is not pure Python, it relies on some features of jupyter notebooks to embed audio files and videos in-line with the comments and explanations.

Demonstrations include how to:

* Generate a sine tone of a specific frequency
* Visualize and playback audio
* Generate a chirp or frequency sweep
* Record audio using your computer's mic
* Load a wav file
* Filter audio with low or high-pass filter

## Setup

1. Install Python
1. Get the code - 2 ways:
    * Install Git, then clone this repository

      ```bash
      git clone <repo-url>
      ```
     * Download and unzip the code
1. Navigate to the code directory from command line
1. Install required Python packages

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Launch the notebook

     ```bash
    jupyter notebook AudioDemo.ipynb
    ```

1. Run the notebook. May be best to run one cell at a time, with `Shift + Enter`
1. Play around! Try editing and running the code cells to play with audio in your own way.
