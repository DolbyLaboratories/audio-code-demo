# Audio Code Demo

A demonstration of how to use Python code to interact with audio

Demonstrations include:

* How to generate a sine tone of a specific frequency
* How to visualize and playback audio
* How to generate a chirp or frequency sweep
* How to record audio using your computer's mic
* How to load a wav file
* How to filter audio

## Setup

1. Install Python
1. Get the code - 2 ways:
   * Install Git, then clone this repository

      ```bash
      git clone <repo-url>
      ```

   * Download and unzip the code
1. Navigate to the code directory from command line
1. Install required Python packages

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Launch the notebook

     ```bash
    jupyter notebook AudioDemo.ipynb
    ```

1. Run the notebook. I find it best to run one cell at a time, with `Shift + Enter`
1. Play around! Try editing and running the code cells to play with audio in your own way.
